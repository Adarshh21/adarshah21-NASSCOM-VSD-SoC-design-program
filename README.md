**QFN-48 Package**: It is one of the type of chip package in which the chip is quadilateral, flat, non linear with 48 pins.

**Core**: Core is the area in the chip where the fundamental logic of the design is placed. It includes all the gates, Muxes and different logics.

**Pads**: Pads are the pins the act as the link between the core and outside world. It is used to send signals from the external world to signal and viceversa.

**Die**: Die is the total size of the chip including the core nad pads.Die is imprinted multiple times along the silicon area or wafer to increase the throughput.

**IPs**: Foundry IPs are manually designed or they need some human intelligence essentially to define and create them like SRAM, ADC, DAC, PLLs.

**Macros**: Macro Cells are the Memory cells. These IPs have been designed by some other Analog design team, which can be used in the floor plan stage of the design.

**PDKs**: Process Design kits are the set of files that are used in the semicundoctor industry to communicate between Foundry and design engineer. It is used  to model a fabrication process for the design tools used to design an integrated circuit. The PDK is created by the foundry defining a certain technology variation for their processes. It is then passed to their customers to use in the design process.
